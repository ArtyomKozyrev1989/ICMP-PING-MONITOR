# ICMP-PING-MONITOR
This is an easy console program which allows to ping several ip addreseses, put results in separate txt files and send email if ip is not  reachable, send email if ip is reachable again. All action are separate for each ip address. The program is not final version, I'm going to add new changes in future, new contributors are welcome.
