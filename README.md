# ICMP-PING-MONITOR
It is an easy console program which allows to ping several ip addresses, put results in separate txt files, distribute files between folders,  send email if ip is not reachable, send email if ip is reachable again. All action are separate for each ip address.

Note that the program can be used only in Windows OS now. 

Feel free to ask questions and give remommendations. Feel free to use the code in your projects or to to learn from.

The program is not the final version, I'm going to add new changes in future, new contributors are welcome.
