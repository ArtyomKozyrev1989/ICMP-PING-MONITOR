# ICMP-PING-MONITOR
This is an easy console program which allows to ping several ip addresses, put results in separate txt files and send email if ip is not  reachable, send email if ip is reachable again. All action are separate for each ip address. Note that the program can be used only in Windows OS. The program is not the final version, I'm going to add new changes in future, new contributors are welcome.
